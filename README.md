This is a React app developed to be a helpful tool to aid in tracking the items you will bring with you on your upcoming trips. To add an item to the list, you can select the quantity and enter the name of the item. You can easily delete an item from the list by clicking on the red X next to the item name. 

You also have the option to sort the item list in 3 orders:
1. By input order
2. By description (alphabetically)
3. By packed status (display packed last)

At the bottom of the page, it will display a summary of how many items you have already packed and the respective percentage.
